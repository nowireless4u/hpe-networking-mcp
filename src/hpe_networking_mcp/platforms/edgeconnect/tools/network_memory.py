Generated from ``vendor/edgeconnect/EdgeConnect-9-7-REST-API.json`` by the
maintainer-local EdgeConnect generator. These generated modules are committed
and are the runtime source of truth; regeneration is a release-time maintainer
workflow (the generator is intentionally not committed — see ``.gitignore``).
