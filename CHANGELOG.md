## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed — Central Write Tools (#99)
- Central delete operations now use bulk endpoint (`DELETE {path}/bulk` with `{"items": [{"id": "..."}]}`) instead of appending ID to URL path
- Central update operations now pass `scopeId` in request body instead of URL path
- Confirmation loop fix: added `confirmed` parameter to all write tools (Mist + Central). When `confirmed=true`, skips re-prompting. The AI sets this after the user confirms in chat.

### Added — Cross-Platform WLAN Sync (#94-98)
- `central_get_wlan_profiles` — read WLAN SSID profiles from Central's config library (`GET /network-config/v1alpha1/wlan-ssids`)
- `central_manage_wlan_profile` — create, update, delete WLAN SSID profiles in Central
- `wlan_mapper.py` — field translation module between Central and Mist WLAN formats
- 3 guided prompts: `sync_wlans_mist_to_central`, `sync_wlans_central_to_mist`, `sync_wlans_bidirectional`
- Tunneled SSIDs automatically excluded from migration

### Added — Site Collection Management
- `add_sites` and `remove_sites` action types for `central_manage_site_collection`
- Uses `POST /network-config/v1/site-collection-add-sites` and `DELETE /network-config/v1/site-collection-remove-sites`

[v0.8.0]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.8.0

## [v0.7.21] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `central_get_sites` — new tool returning site configuration data (address, timezone, scopeName) from `network-config/v1/sites` with OData filter and sort support

### Changed
- Renamed old `central_get_sites` → `central_get_site_health` to accurately reflect it returns health metrics, not site config data
- Central tool count: 45 → 46 (+ 12 prompts)

### Fixed
- `central_get_site_health` crash (`KeyError: 'name'`) when sites returned from the health API lack a `name` field (e.g. newly created sites)

[v0.7.21]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.21

## [v0.7.20] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Central site creation payload: timezone is required, all field values must use full names (no abbreviations). Updated tool description, INSTRUCTIONS.md, and TOOLS.md with correct format.

[v0.7.20]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.20

## [v0.7.19] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Central write tools sending payload as query params instead of JSON body — pycentral `command()` uses `api_data` for request body, not `api_params`
- Added `api_data` parameter to `retry_central_command` for POST/PUT body support

[v0.7.19]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.19

## [v0.7.18] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Central write tools using wrong API version (`v1` instead of `v1alpha1`) for sites, site-collections, and device-groups endpoints, causing DNS resolution failures

[v0.7.18]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.18

## [v0.7.17] - 2026-04-14

### Changed — Write Tool Confirmation
- Create operations now execute immediately without confirmation
- Update and delete operations require user confirmation (via elicitation prompt or AI chat confirmation)
- Matches the expected behavior: creates are safe, updates/deletes need approval

[v0.7.17]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.17

## [v0.7.16] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed — Write Tool Confirmation
- When `DISABLE_ELICITATION=false` and the client doesn't support elicitation prompts, write tools now return a `confirmation_required` response instructing the AI to confirm with the user in chat before re-calling the tool
- Previously, write tools auto-accepted silently when the client lacked elicitation support, bypassing user confirmation entirely

### Changed
- Elicitation middleware now tracks three modes: `disabled` (auto-accept), `prompt` (elicitation dialog), `chat_confirm` (AI asks user in conversation)

[v0.7.16]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.16

## [v0.7.15] - 2026-04-14

### Changed — Central Dynamic Registration (Issue #80)
- Converted Central tool registration from explicit imports to dynamic `TOOLS` dict + `importlib` pattern, matching Mist
- All 15 Central tool modules now use `_registry.mcp` decorator pattern instead of `register(mcp)` wrapper functions

### Fixed — Write Tool Visibility
- ElicitationMiddleware no longer overrides write tool visibility when client lacks elicitation support — write tools stay visible when enabled by config
- In-tool `elicitation_handler` now auto-accepts gracefully when client can't prompt (instead of throwing ToolError)
- Mist and Central write tools conditionally skip registration when their platform write flag is disabled

### Removed
- `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS` global flag — replaced by per-platform `ENABLE_MIST_WRITE_TOOLS` and `ENABLE_CENTRAL_WRITE_TOOLS`

[v0.7.15]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.15

## [v0.7.14] - 2026-04-13

### Added — Central Write Tools
- `central_manage_site` — create, update, and delete sites via `network-config/v1/sites`
- `central_manage_site_collection` — create, update, and delete site collections via `network-config/v1/site-collections`
- `central_manage_device_group` — create, update, and delete device groups via `network-config/v1/device-groups`
- All write tools gated behind `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` with elicitation confirmation

### Fixed
- Write tool visibility: server.py Visibility transform and elicitation middleware now handle both `write` and `write_delete` tags consistently

### Changed
- Central tool count: 42 → 45 (+ 12 prompts)

[v0.7.14]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.14

## [v0.7.13] - 2026-04-13

### Added — Mist Best-Practice Guardrails
- `guardrails.py` validation module — inspects write tool payloads and warns when operations violate Mist best practices (site-level WLAN creation, hardcoded RADIUS IPs, fixed RF channels/power, static PSKs)
- Guardrails integrated into all 4 Mist write tools — warnings in elicitation message, suggestions in tool response
- `provision_site_from_template` prompt — guided workflow for cloning a site using templates
- `bulk_provision_sites` prompt — guided workflow for bulk site creation with source config analysis done once
- Mist Best Practices section in INSTRUCTIONS.md

### Added — Central Scope Tool Improvements
- Enriched scope tree output with `persona_count`, `resource_count`, `child_scope_count`, `device_count`, per-persona `categories` breakdown
- `include_details` parameter on `central_get_effective_config` — exposes full resource configuration data
- `inheritance_path` in effective config output — ordered path from Global to target scope
- `scope_configuration_overview` and `scope_effective_config` guided prompts
- Split `scope_builder.py` into `scope_builder.py` + `scope_queries.py`
- Mermaid diagram device labels now use hostnames instead of model numbers

### Changed
- Mist tool count: 35 tools + 2 prompts
- Central tool count: 42 tools + 12 prompts (was 10)
- Test count: 176 (was 119)

[v0.7.13]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.13

## [v0.7.12] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Site update/delete calling nonexistent `mistapi.api.v1.orgs.sites.updateOrgSite` / `deleteOrgSite` — fixed to `mistapi.api.v1.sites.sites.updateSiteInfo(site_id)` and `deleteSite(site_id)`

[v0.7.12]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.12

## [v0.7.11] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `sites` object type for `mist_change_org_configuration_objects` and `mist_update_org_configuration_objects` — enables site create, update, and delete via write tools

### Fixed
- Write tools failing with "AI App does not support elicitation" when both `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` and `DISABLE_ELICITATION=true` — missing `ctx.set_state("disable_elicitation", True)` in the elicitation middleware

### Changed
- `__version__` now reads dynamically from package metadata instead of being hardcoded
- `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for version

[v0.7.11]: https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp/releases/tag/v0.7.11

### Improved

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- `mist_search_device`: removed `vc_mac` parameter not supported by installed `mistapi` SDK version — fixes 503 errors on device search
- `mist_search_device`: use kwargs dict to only pass non-None parameters to SDK — prevents unexpected keyword argument errors
